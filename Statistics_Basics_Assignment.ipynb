Covariance measures the direction and magnitude of the linear relationship, while correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship, but in a standardized way. Covariance can take any value from negative to positive infinity, and its value can be affected by the scale of the variables. Correlation, on the other hand, is standardized and always falls between -1 and 1, making it easier to interpret the strength of the relationship, according to Statistics and the University of Michigan and SlideShare.\n",
